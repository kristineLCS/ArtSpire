Report Function:
A report button will be found at the bottom of every post uploaded by users. Users can select between the 5 categories they think the report should go under. A description box is also available for users to expand their resons for reporting the post. Once submitted, the report will be sent to the administration and can be seen under homepage/post reports. Once reviewed by the admin, they can have the option to delete the post if the post does contain inappropiate content, or keep the post up if the post does not contain inappropiate content. Once the decision is made, the admin can update the status of the report to pending, reviewed, action taken, and dismissed
