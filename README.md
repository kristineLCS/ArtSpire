# ArtSpire-repo

ArtSpire is a platform designed to inspire both artists and hobbyists to create art. Its goal is to nurture artistic habits and help users overcome creative blocks by offering a variety of categories that generate art prompts tailored to their chosen themes. A Community page will be available for users to post their art and for everyone to view.

Features/Functions:

OpenAi:
I used OpenAi to help generate art prompts. With the help of https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/ .
I was able to build an art prompt generator that generates prompts with different categories.

Weekl Challenge Feature:
The weekly challenge feature can be updated everyweek through the admin panel under "Weekly Challenges". The new challenge will automatically be updated in the homepage banner.

Like & Comment feature:
Inspried by any social media platforms, I added a like and comment section for posts to allow users to interact with each other. I got help from YouTube to build my like function https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXqRPqDjDgc&list=PLCC34OHNcOtr025c1kHSPrnP18YPB-NFi&index=18 .

Feedback Feature:
A Feedback Form will be found at the bottom of the homepage that will be available for users. For better user experience, I decided to add this feature to gather information on what needs to be improved, what features are good, and any features they want to be added. This feedback will be sent to the admin panel, where the admin can view the submissions.

Report Feature:
A report button will be found at the bottom of every post uploaded by users. Users can select between the 5 categories they think the report should go under. A description box is also available for users to expand their resons for reporting the post. Once submitted, the report will be sent to the administration and can be seen under homepage/post reports. Once reviewed by the admin, they can have the option to delete the post if the post does contain inappropiate content, or keep the post up if the post does not contain inappropiate content. Once the decision is made, the admin can update the status of the report to pending, reviewed, action taken, and dismissed

Tag Feature:
In captions (body) section of the post form, users can include # in their captions i.e. #art. This hashtag will become active and other users/guests can click into the hashtags and see other posts that has this hashtags. This is good for users to view what other users are posting for a specific challenge. 

Post History Feature:
Once a user posts on the community page, the post is automatically saved to their Post History in their profile page. This is to keep track of what they have posted. Alternatively, users can also click on their (or any users) usernames in the community page from a post they have posted, and they will be directed to a page where posts from that specific user will be displayed.
